# Reddit-Inertia
<table>
<tr>
<td>
  A web app for a custom reddit dashboard using the new features from Laravel v8.0, which uses the InertiaJS framework to render components instead of traditional html templates. This is more of a learning/experimental project to try out their Single-Page App approach with React instead of Vue, also Jest & PHPUnit for testing, and Docker as a container.
